      <p>Hello and Welcome! My name is Artem</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a huge railway fan for as long as I can remember myself. My
        favorite part about railway is signalling. When I was small I created
        pictures of each aspect on a small piece of paper with the meaning on
        the back. Sadly, with years passing by, I lost them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, that I started to learn web development, I decided to recreate what
        I had in mind back then - a unified place for information about railway
        signalling systems around the world that anyone can access at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I know, that wikipedia exists, but I want
        to create something myself or, as they say, reinvent the wheel.
