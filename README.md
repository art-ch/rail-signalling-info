# [Rail Signalling Info](https://rail-signalling-info.netlify.app/)

This is my first project using React.

# History

I'm a huge railway fan for as long as I can remember myself. My favorite part about railway is signalling. When I was small I created pictures of each aspect on a small piece of paper with the meaning on the back. Sadly, with years passing by, I lost them all.

Now, that I started to learn web development, I decided to recreate what I had in mind back then - a unified place for information about railway signalling systems around the world that anyone can access at any time.

P.S. I know that wikipedia exists, but I want to create something myself or, as they say, reinvent the wheel.

# Side notes

All info will be taken from third party websites (including wikipedia) and all links for original sources will be provided, where applicable.

I also have an idea to create a quiz tool that would utilize all the info website provides.

# State of development

Slow and steady
