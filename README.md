# Rail Signalling Info (is not ready to be deployed yet)

This is my first project using React.

# History

I'm a huge railway fan for as long as I can remember myself. My favorite part about railway is signalling. When I was small I created pictures of each aspect on a small piece of paper with the meaning on the back. Sadly, with years passing by, I lost them all.

Now, that I started to learn web development, I decided to recreate what I had in mind back then - a unified place for information about railway signalling systems around the world that anyone can access at any time.

P.S. I know that wikipedia exists, but I want to create something myself or, as they say, reinvent the wheel.

# Side notes

All info will be taken from third party websites (including wikipedia) and all links for original sources will be provided, where applicable.

I also have an idea to create a quiz tool that would utilize all the info website provides.

# State of development

Stalled because of bootcamp.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
